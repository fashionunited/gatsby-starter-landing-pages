                                        <p>VF has a reputation for being a fun and lively company to work for. “We all come to work in jeans — even the Credit Director wears jeans. It’s a pretty flexible atmosphere,” she says. “The approximately 200 associates in the Credit Control Department are top-notch people, who, despite the easy environment, take their work very seriously. There is no doubt about the importance of reaching our goals.”</p>
                                        <p>
                                            Aurelie loves being in the middle of a completely international group of people. “You meet so many different people from different cultures – French, Swiss, German, Polish, Dutch, Spanish, Irish, Italian — and they all make a real effort to be helpful and welcoming,” she says. “VF is like one big family — we all look after each other. There is always somebody willing to take the time to answer your questions or help you find the information you need. The support is awesome and I am constantly learning something new.”</p>
                                        <p>
                                            As far as Aurelie is concerned, the secret to success in VF is taking up opportunities to learn and grow, while building great relationships with those around you. She says, “It’s the go-getter that gets things done.”</p>

                                        <p>VF relocated Maneesha from Scotland to the Nottingham office in the UK. “They made it all so easy. They have a focal point who deals with relocations,” Maneesha explains. “She sent me maps and advised me about everything, such as doctors and banks, and VF also provided financial help. When I arrived in Nottingham, I stayed at a good hotel until I could find a flat to move into. The focal point gave me a list of suitable flats to view and my team leader was very understanding about me having to go during working hours.”
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            When she started at VF, Maneesha was quite apprehensive because she didn’t think she was any good at accounting. “I realise now how unnecessary fear was because they trained me to work with the entire system before I actually moved on. I started at Vans and then moved over to Timberland. Being a credit controller involves a wide range of tasks and it is never boring. I am so proud to be working with a big, growing brand.”

                                            Maneesha is overawed by all the support that is available within VF. “There is never an excuse to give up because there is always someone around who is willing to help you,” she says. “The team is so well-equipped; and our managers and VP are so normal. They speak to us as equals and are totally down to earth. I have learnt so much in the 14 months since I joined the company and I look forward to learning more every day.”</p>

                                        <p>Kai says that he has been given valuable opportunities to develop his skills and grow personally. “VF is a company that hires people who fit in with the culture of the organisation, while providing you will any training, mentoring and assistance that you need along the way. I have a wonderful team leader whose door is always open for me to ask for help.”

                                            Moving to Nottingham was unexpectedly easy for Kai. “The company took care of everything,” he explains. “After finding out what I had in mind, they sent me a list of houses to view and it wasn’t long before I had settled into a charming house in the country with my husband and our two Jack Russell Terriers. They also provided an additional month’s salary to cover incidental moving expenses.”</p>

                                        <p>He is responsible for customer service for jeanswear in Italy, but also supports Spain. “I am also being involved in other projects,” he says. “The company is huge, which gives one infinite possibilities. It’s up to you to achieve what is possible.”

                                            The wide range of nationalities and levels of education is one of VF’s great attractions. “The diversity is incredible,” he says. “You meet people from everywhere, not just here, in all VF’s offices.”

                                            With 10 years of experience behind him, Ettore is able to judge the calibre of VF’s leaders quite well. “They take care of people more than a lot of other companies,” he says. “There is constant support. My manager, is always helping me with every single thing I need. You can’t know everything, so when you have questions he will help me, if he doesn’t he knows where to address me”

I am so sure about my future with VF that I am buying a house here in Nottingham.” </p>

                                        <p>VF people come from all over the world to create a wonderful mix of collaboration, tolerance and pride. “I think people truly enjoy working here because we are entrusted with responsibilities that challenge us in a good way and because it is a casual yet professional working environment. I got my own key account quite early, and such responsibility is very motivating. At the same time, you can always feel safe that you have someone to ask if you need help and guidance.”

                                            As an outdoor lifestyle brand, Timberland has a big focus on sustainability, Silje explains. “Timberland pays all its employees for 40 hours’ volunteer work every year. This Earth Day they helped Mansfield Community Rangers in Nottinghamshire. It is a project that has been running for years and relies heavily on volunteers to help transform an old abandoned coal mining site around the Mansfield area into woodlands. “I’m proud of working for a brand and company that focus so strongly on ethics and sustainability,” she says.</p>

It’s my job to motivate them to do better every day; and to provide the kind of environment that makes their experience more enjoyable. If people are happy at work they will succeed.”

                                            The question of who motivates the motivators often arises. “I have sat in presentations by some of our top VF executives, who are visionaries and have the ability to inspire incredible loyalty,” James says. “They create a desire, dedication and commitment that helps people buy into their vision. If someone fails to leave these kinds of presentations inspired, they have a problem.”

                                            The huge number of opportunities available to people within VF is a major drawcard for most associates. “It is really important to know what you want from your career and where you want to go to achieve it,” James says. “That’s why I have always had a five-year plan for my career. I chart where I want to go. You can’t wait for other people to look after your career, you have to do it yourself. If you wait for conditions to go from good to perfect, you will wait forever.” </p>

<p>Nottingham itself is famous around the world as the setting for Robin Hood and Sherwood Forest where Robin Hood lived with his band of merry men! It also has many historic buildings and sites including Nottingham Castle and has great shops, restaurants, bars, night life, concerts and shows.</p><p>
The city is right in the middle of the UK so is the perfect location for great days out. The Peak District, an area of outstanding natural beauty, is right on your doorstep and a short drive can get you to the vibrant city of Manchester and Birmingham or to the historic Lincoln. You can even get to one of the UK’s great seaside resorts in about 1 hour. There are plenty of opportunities for walking, climbing, running, water sports plus other outdoor pursuits.</p><p>
The public transport links are great, trains to London take 1½ hours and the tram and bus links around the city are modern and fast.</p><p>
For associates with families, there are numerous great schools to choose from and the city is very family friendly…they even have a beach in the city centre during the summer. Associates can choose to live in the vibrant city or opt for a more relaxed, laid back, rural living.</p>

                            Retail is also branded by special events in Europe. VF always tries to deliver a unique experience and combine it with the brand philosophy. In London, VF has established the House of Vans which is a famous skate park for enthusiast and skating heads. It is the embodiment of Vans and the Skate culture.

                            In one the North Face stores in London, we integrated a cooling chamber. Thus people were able to test the jackets and other products in terms of protector for the frostiness.

                        <p>At VF we don´t consider ecommerce as something which is negative for our business but as a chance to drive our performance and provide a seamless Omni channel experience to the customers. For this reason we developed our recruiting strategy into an digital candidate experience which means that we created certain tools that underline the digital environment of retail. After a successful recruiting we are going to build a workforce, which is:</p>
                        <ul class="fu-vf-list-layout">
                            <li>Capable of being channel agnostic</li>

                        <p>Across Europe we are working with “Sales Pads” that supports the employees and helping to combine different channels to match the customers expectations.
                        Engagement is one of the most important topic in retail. Thus we are always trying to set new initiatives such as the “Conversion Olympics” which was the biggest project at VF. Its goal was to engage and motivate the employees and at the same time generating ideas out of the heads of our retail experts in store.</p>

                            Be part of our unique store management culture. At VF our store manager have the chance to participate in European retail meetings and network with other store manager across Europe. For instance in 2016, the Lee retail meeting was held in Greece. In 2017 our Vans retail summit was hosted in Palma de Mallorca and was full of surprises. Nobody else than Steve van Doren visited the retail management during the summit in Palma. Steve, whose father had co-founded the company more than 50 years ago, works almost his whole life for Vans and is the spirit behind the skate culture.

                         The secret behind the success of VF is for her the adaptive culture and “a lot of attention is being paid to the well-being of its employees” she mentioned as well.</p>

                        One of VF´s key objectives is to create awareness of the opportunity to develop a career in retail. On account of this we have created a unique training and development culture for our employees in retail. To provide an compelling career does not mean to undergo your career through a “ladder” on which you can only take the next steps, if is not occupied. It means that we give you a stewardship for your entire journey. We help you to develop different skills within your job profile and support you to get mandatory skills for the next steps. There is no ladder but a <strong>Retail Gym</strong> where you can choose your way and set your pace whether it is a the next position or growing into a head office position. It does not depend on which position you start, whether it is a temporary worker or Supervisor, you will always have the opportunity to develop your career.

                            The Napapijri® brand began its journey in 1987. It draws its inspiration from the shadow of Europe’s highest peak, the Monte Bianco, where an Italian travel bag manufacturer mixed design innovation with style and revolutionized outdoor apparel.</p>
                        <p>
                            The Napapijri® brand is a variation of the Finnish word for the Arctic Circle and the logo, half positive and half negative, gives visual expression to the North and South Poles.</p>
