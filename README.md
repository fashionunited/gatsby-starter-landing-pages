# Gatsby Starter Landing Pages

A blog starter skeleton with advanced features for [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/).

* [Demo website on GitHub Pages.](https://fashionunited.github.io/gatsby-starter-landing-pages/)

For performance comparisons the demo is also hosted on:

* [Firebase Hosting](https://gatsby-starter-landing-pages.firebaseapp.com/)
* [Netlify](https://gatsby-landing-pages.netlify.com/)

Compare latency with Apex.sh, this is far from a scientific method though.

* [GitHub Pages vs Firebase](https://latency.apex.sh/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffashionunited.github.io/gatsby-starter-landing-pages/&compare=https%3A%2F%2Fgatsby-starter-landing-pages.firebaseapp.com/)

Inspired by both [Gatsby Advanced Starter](https://github.com/Vagr9K/gatsby-advanced-starter) & [Gatsby Starter Gatsbythemes](https://github.com/saschajullmann/gatsby-starter-gatsbythemes).

## Deploy to Firebase Hosting

    firebase init
    firebase login:ci

Store the token you get as variable FIREBASE_DEPLOY_KEY in GitLab. This is used in .gitlab-ci.yml to deploy to Firebase Hosting.

## Why?

This project aims to provide a minimal for building GatsbyJS powered blogs.

It provides basic components for SEO/Social Media/UI. Since we believe in the power of CSS-in-JS, Emotion is included for styling.

NOTE: This project serves as a base for [Gatsby Starter Landing Pages Material Web Components](https://github.com/fashionunited/gatsby-starter-landing-pages-material-web-components). That project uses React Material Web Components to implement Material Design as close to what Google intended as possible.

## How can I use this?

If you are interested in building websites that are highly optimized, for SEO and performance, you can use this an unstyled, "minimal" starter.

## Features

* Images with Blur-Up technique

* CSS-in-JS via [Emotion](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion).
  <!-- * Jest and Enzyme for testing.
* Eslint in dev mode with the airbnb config and prettier formatting rules.
* React 16. -->
  <!-- * A basic blog, with posts under src/pages/blog. There's also a script which creates a new Blog entry (post.sh). -->
* Data per JSON files.
  <!-- * A few basic components (Navigation, Footer, Layout).
* Layout components make use of [Styled-System](https://github.com/jxnblk/styled-system).
* Google Analytics (you just have to enter your tracking-id).
* Gatsby-Plugin-Offline which includes Service Workers.
* [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) for a uniform codebase.
* [Normalize](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/) css (7.0).
* [Feather](https://feather.netlify.com/) icons.
* Font styles taken from [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io/). -->
