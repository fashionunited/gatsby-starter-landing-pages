If I had the power, I would ban leggings. Jeans represent democracy in fashion. I believe that my clothes can give people a better image of themselves - that it can increase their feelings of confidence and happiness. I try as much as possible to give you a great basic product and what comes out, I feel, is really amazing. Being one step ahead of a fashion trend is not so important to me. What matters is to always forge ahead.

I'd like to believe that the women who wear my clothes are not dressing for other people, that they're wearing what they like and what suits them. It's not a status thing. I never like to think that I design for a particular person. I design for the woman I wanted to be, the woman I used to be, and - to some degree - the woman I'm still a little piece of. Online media is increasingly influential in fashion. Women are more sure of themselves today. They don't have to emulate the way men dress. Women are more sure of themselves today. They don't have to emulate the way men dress.

All I did my first year at Vogue was Xerox. There are always protests, whether you do something good or bad. Even if you do something beneficial, people say you do it because it's advertising. I try to contrast; life today is full of contrast... We have to change. I love the 2000s because everyone started to love haute couture. Men don't want another man to look at their woman because they don't know how to handle it.
