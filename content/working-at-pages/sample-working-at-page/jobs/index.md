I never like to think that I design for a particular person. I design for the woman I wanted to be, the woman I used to be, and - to some degree - the woman I'm still a little piece of. You have to stay true to your heritage; that's what your brand is about. Never in my wildest dreams did I entertain the idea that I would become a fashion designer. We live in an era of globalization and the era of the woman. Never in the history of the world have women been more in control of their destiny. It should be natural, and that's how I like women to look. I like them to feel comfortable and look organic.

I've treated the waistcoat as if it were a corset, so that it becomes the first layer in the process of putting clothes on the body. There is constant motion between layering and revealing. I love things that age well - things that don't date, that stand the test of time and that become living examples of the absolute best. Fashion is to please your eye. Shapes and proportions are for your intellect. Fashion to me has become very disposable; I wanted to get back to craft, to clothes that could last. I am especially grateful that I have been able to keep my own style over the decades, in spite of the many changes that have taken place in the world of fashion and in its business.

Clothes can transform your mood and confidence. I am convinced that you don't need to spend a fortune to look like a million. Design and style should work toward making you look good and feel good without a lot of effort so you can get on with the things that matter. I believe that my clothes can give people a better image of themselves - that it can increase their feelings of confidence and happiness. Grunge is a hippied romantic version of punk.

Dressing up. People just don't do it anymore. We have to change that. I always loved aesthetics. Not particularly fashion, but an idea of beauty. It's really easy to get colors right. It's really hard to get black - and neutrals - right. Black is certainly a color but it's also an illusion. I don't like trends. They tend to make everybody look the same. First I made a dress because I was pregnant and I wanted to be the most beautiful pregnant woman. Then I made a sweater because I wanted to have one that wasn't like anyone else's.

You can't just buy things for the label - it's ridiculous. I wish I had invented blue jeans. They have expression, modesty, sex appeal, simplicity - all I hope for in my clothes. It is not easy to dress well. We look our best in subdued colors, sophisticated cuts, and a general air of sleek understatement. There is always an emotional element to anything that you make.
