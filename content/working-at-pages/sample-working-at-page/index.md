My shows are about the complete woman who swallows it all. It's a question of survival. A woman is never sexier than when she is comfortable in her clothes. I love things that age well - things that don't date, that stand the test of time and that become living examples of the absolute best. Comfort is very important to me. I think people live better in big houses and in big clothes. I would like to be a one-man multinational fashion phenomenon.

Nostalgia is a very complicated subject for me. I'm attracted by nostalgia but I refuse it intellectually. That is the key of this collection, being yourself. Don't be into trends. Don't make fashion own you, but you decide what you are, what you want to express by the way you dress and the way to live. Fashion can be this mysterious thing that you can't explain. My job is to bring out in people what they wouldn't dare do themselves. An evening dress that reveals a woman's ankles while walking is the most disgusting thing I have ever seen.
