I am not interested in the past, except as the road to the future. I always loved aesthetics. Not particularly fashion, but an idea of beauty. If you cut a painter's hands off, he'd still feel the urge to pick up a brush. I don't try to be in fashion; I don't try to follow trends. You just end up out of fashion that way. There has to be a balance between your mental satisfaction and the financial needs of your company.

It's useless to send models out on the runway to cry. The market is like a language, and you have to be able to understand what they're saying. Dressing is a way of life. I am convinced that you don't need to spend a fortune to look like a million. It should be natural, and that's how I like women to look. I like them to feel comfortable and look organic.
