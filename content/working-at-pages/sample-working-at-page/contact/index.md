The market is like a language, and you have to be able to understand what they're saying. I love my beauty. It's not my fault. Fashion can be this mysterious thing that you can't explain. Men don't want another man to look at their woman because they don't know how to handle it. A lot of self-importance goes on in the fashion industry. I'm not like that.

It's hard to balance everything. It's always challenging. It is not easy to dress well. We have got to change our ethics and our financial system and our whole way of understanding the world. It has to be a world in which people live rather than die; a sustainable world. It could be great. Sometimes the simplest things are the most profound. I feel that things happen for a reason and open up new opportunities.
