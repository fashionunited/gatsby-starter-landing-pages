# I still appreciate individuality. Style is much more interesting than fashion, really.

## It's useless to send models out on the runway to cry.

War taught me that not everything is glamorous. It's sometimes said that I'm rebellious and I do things to push people's buttons, but I just like the challenge. I wanted to dress the woman who lives and works, not the woman in a painting. Women are more sure of themselves today. They don't have to emulate the way men dress. First I made a dress because I was pregnant and I wanted to be the most beautiful pregnant woman. Then I made a sweater because I wanted to have one that wasn't like anyone else's.

I love women's fashion, but women don't need me as much as men do. It's the men who have nothing to wear. Insecurity is a waste of time. For me, art is about learning and about living with people. It's alive. You have to be luxurious nude. It's difficult to move in the nude in front of a mirror. It's much easier to move when you're dressed. But if you can walk around in the nude easily in front of your man, if you can be luxurious in the nude, then you've really got it. It pains me physically to see a woman victimized, rendered pathetic, by fashion.

## I like the irony in my work.

I always say: To be well dressed you must be well naked. I love to design things that people can actually buy. I'm staggered by what a boot costs today. In a meat-eating world, wearing leather for shoes and clothes and even handbags, the discussion of fur is childish. I remember walking the dog one day, I saw a car full of teenage girls, and one of them rolled down the window and yelled, 'Marc Jacobs!' in a French accent. Clothes can transform your mood and confidence.

In a meat-eating world, wearing leather for shoes and clothes and even handbags, the discussion of fur is childish. I never like to think that I design for a particular person. I design for the woman I wanted to be, the woman I used to be, and - to some degree - the woman I'm still a little piece of. Sometimes incompetence is useful. It helps you keep an open mind. I was the first person to have a punk rock hairstyle. Fashions fade, style is eternal.

## I always thought what you wore underneath was as important as what you wear on top.

If I had the power, I would ban leggings. I have an obsession with details and pattern. I always thought what you wore underneath was as important as what you wear on top. I've always tried to push myself technically and to push myself visually. That's been part of the journey. There are only three things I can do - make a dress, decorate a house, and entertain people.

> My dresses are very reasonably priced, for dresses that are cut on the body. I think in the darkest moments, we need a break. Attention to detail is of utmost importance when you want to look good.

We have got to change our ethics and our financial system and our whole way of understanding the world.
